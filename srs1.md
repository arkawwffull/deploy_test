# Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

## 1. Introduction

The healthcare industry is undergoing a significant transformation, driven by technological advancements and the growing demand for accessible and efficient healthcare services. This project aims to address the critical need for improved appointment scheduling and management systems within small and medium-sized healthcare practices (SMEs).  Many SMEs lack the resources to implement sophisticated digital solutions, limiting their outreach and patient satisfaction. This application will empower these providers by offering a user-friendly, secure, and scalable platform that streamlines appointment scheduling, improves patient communication, and ensures adherence to relevant data privacy regulations like HIPAA and GDPR.  The real-world significance of this project lies in its potential to enhance the efficiency and accessibility of healthcare services for a wider range of patients, particularly in underserved communities.


## 2. Purpose

This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document serves as a comprehensive guide for all stakeholders involved in the development and deployment of the healthcare appointment scheduling application.  It clearly defines the business and technical requirements, outlining the functional capabilities, performance expectations, security considerations, and technical architecture.  This document ensures that everyone involved shares a common understanding of the project scope and objectives, reducing ambiguity and facilitating efficient collaboration throughout the development lifecycle.  The business objectives focus on expanding market reach for SMEs, enhancing patient satisfaction, and improving operational efficiency. The technical objectives prioritize security, scalability, and maintainability of the application.


## 3. Scope

This project focuses on the development and deployment of a web and mobile application designed to streamline the appointment scheduling process for both patients and healthcare providers. The scope includes:

* **Functional Scope:**  Patient registration and login, appointment booking and management, online payment processing, medical record access, prescription management, practitioner profile viewing, symptom checker, and staff management tools (user account management, service management, reporting).
* **Non-Functional Scope:**  System performance, scalability, security, availability, maintainability, usability, and compliance with relevant healthcare regulations (HIPAA, GDPR, etc.).
* **Regulatory Scope:**  Adherence to all applicable data privacy regulations, including HIPAA, GDPR, and payment gateway standards.
* **Operational Scope:**  Cloud-based deployment, disaster recovery planning, and maintenance procedures.

### 3.1 In Scope

* Patient self-scheduling and management of appointments.
* Secure online payments for appointments.
* Access to medical records and prescriptions.
* Practitioner profile viewing with availability information.
* AI-driven symptom checker for patients.
* Staff management tools for creating, editing, and deleting user accounts.
* Management of services offered by the healthcare provider.
* Comprehensive reporting capabilities for financial, operational, and patient data.

### 3.2 Out of Scope

Integration with third-party suppliers such as ambulance operators, pharmacists, and medical tourism agencies are out of scope for this initial release.  Similarly, inpatient functionalities (IPD) are excluded from this version.  Due to the multi-tenant SaaS architecture, an aggregator model is not implemented.  Each patient will be associated with a single healthcare provider's instance of the application.

### 3.3 Assumptions

* This project assumes that healthcare providers will grant access to interface this application with their existing Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems.

### 3.4 Dependencies

* Seamless integration with various EHR systems (using HL7 FHIR, CDA, or custom integration methods as needed) and secure payment gateways. Robust error handling and contingency plans for external system outages are necessary.
* PostgreSQL (recommended), or a suitable relational database with support for JSON data types. Proper indexing is essential for performance.
* AWS, Azure, or GCP (choice dependent on client requirements and existing infrastructure). Multi-tenant architecture is required.

## 7. Data Model

The data model will be relational, utilizing a database such as PostgreSQL.  Key entities will include:

* **Patients:**  PatientID (PK), FirstName, LastName, DOB, Address, PhoneNumber, Email, EmergencyContact, MedicalHistory (JSON), etc.
* **Practitioners:** PractitionerID (PK), FirstName, LastName, Specialty, Availability (JSON), etc.
* **Appointments:** AppointmentID (PK), PatientID (FK), PractitionerID (FK), AppointmentDate, AppointmentTime, AppointmentType, Status (e.g., Scheduled, Completed, Cancelled), PaymentStatus, etc.
* **Services:** ServiceID (PK), ServiceName, Description, Price, etc.
* **Prescriptions:** PrescriptionID (PK), AppointmentID (FK), Medication, Dosage, Instructions, etc.
* **MedicalRecords:** MedicalRecordID (PK), PatientID (FK), RecordDate, Diagnosis, etc.

Relationships will be defined using foreign keys to link related entities.  The `MedicalHistory` attribute in the `Patients` table will store a JSON object for flexible data representation of patient medical information.  Appropriate indexes will be implemented to optimize database performance.  Database normalization principles will be followed to ensure data integrity and minimize redundancy.  Data flow diagrams will be developed to illustrate the movement of data between entities and system components.

## 8. User Characteristics

The application will cater to three primary user roles:

* **Patients:**  Patients will vary in age, tech proficiency, and health literacy.  User interface design will prioritize intuitiveness and accessibility.  Personas will be developed to represent different patient segments and guide design decisions.
* **Practitioners:**  Practitioners will expect efficient access to patient information and tools for managing appointments and generating prescriptions.  The interface will be designed to minimize clicks and maximize efficiency.
* **Healthcare Provider Staff:**  Staff will need administrative access to manage user accounts, services, and generate reports.  The interface will provide comprehensive functionality and reporting capabilities.

Usability testing will be conducted throughout the development process to ensure the application meets the needs of all user roles.  Accessibility features will be implemented to comply with WCAG guidelines.

## 9. Codification Schemes

A consistent naming convention will be adopted throughout the application, including:

* **Database Tables:**  Camel case (e.g., patientAppointments).
* **Variables:**  Camel case (e.g., patientFirstName).
* **Functions:**  Camel case (e.g., updatePatientProfile).

A version control system (e.g., Git) will be used to manage code changes and maintain a history of revisions.  Data classification rules will be established to determine the sensitivity of different data elements and apply appropriate security measures.  A structured numbering system will be used for requirements, use cases, and other documents.  All coding standards must follow best practices to maintain code readability.
